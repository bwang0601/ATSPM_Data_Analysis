This wedsite is to introduce the ATSPMs data analysis 

More about ATSPM: "ATSPMs use detector data to show actual and historical performance of signalized intersections. They use high-resolution data capability added to existing infrastructure to evaluate the quality of progression of traffic along a corridor. In Utah, the measured data alert UDOT of detector malfunctions and provide insight into vehicle delay from volume, speed, and travel time detection. UDOT uses the data to optimize mobility and manage traffic signal timing and maintenance to reduce congestion, save fuel costs, and improve safety (UDOT, 2019b)."
